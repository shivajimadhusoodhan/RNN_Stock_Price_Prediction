## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to try and predict the stock prices using historical data from four companies IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT).

We use four different companies because they belong to the same sector: Technology. Using data from all four companies may improve the performance of the model. This way, we can capture the broader market sentiment.

The problem statement for this assignment can be summarised as follows:

> Given the stock prices of Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft for a set number of days, predict the stock price of these companies after that window.
